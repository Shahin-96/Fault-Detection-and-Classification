# Fault Detection and Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning models to detect and classify electrical faults in a three-phase power system using current (Ia, Ib, Ic) and voltage (Va, Vb, Vc) data. The workflow involves data preprocessing, model training using various algorithms, evaluation of accuracy/error metrics, and visualization for model comparison.
All experiments were performed using Python in Google Colab.

## Dataset

Two datasets were used:

detect_dataset.xlsx ‚Üí Used for fault detection (binary classification: fault/no-fault)

classData.csv ‚Üí Used for fault classification (multi-class: A, B, C, G)

### Features:

Ia, Ib, Ic, Va, Vb, Vc

### Targets:

Detection target: Output (S) ‚Üí 0 = No Fault, 1 = Fault

Classification target: A, B, C, G ‚Üí fault type identifiers

## Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
 - Missing columns were dropped (dropna(axis=1)).
 - Data split into train (67%) and test (33%) sets using train_test_split().
 - Normalized class distribution visualized using Seaborn bar plots.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Models Implemented
The following models were trained and evaluated separately for detection and classification:
| Model | Accuracy (Detection) | Accuracy (Classification) |
|:--|:--:|:--:|
| Linear Regression | 0.7384 | 0.0324 |
| Logistic Regression | 0.9536 | 0.316 |
| Polynomial Regression | 0.9914 | 0.945 |
| Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) | 0.9806 ü•â| 0.886 |
| Naive Bayes | 0.9942 | 0.797 |
| Decision Tree | 0.9821 ü•á | 0.865 |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 0.9924 | 0.317 |
| K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | 0.9924 ü•à | 0.8246 |

üìä Model Comparison

The project concludes with graphical comparisons of:

Accuracy vs. Model

Error (MSE) vs. Model

These visualizations clearly demonstrate that Decision Tree, MLP, and KNN models achieved the highest detection accuracy, while Polynomial Regression provided the best balance for classification.
