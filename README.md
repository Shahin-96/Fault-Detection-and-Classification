# Fault Detection and Classification

## Project Overview
This project implements multiple machine learning models to detect and classify electrical faults in a three-phase power system using current (Ia, Ib, Ic) and voltage (Va, Vb, Vc) data. The workflow involves data preprocessing, model training using various algorithms, evaluation of accuracy/error metrics, and visualization for model comparison.
All experiments were performed using Python in Google Colab.

## Dataset

Two datasets were used:

detect_dataset.xlsx ‚Üí Used for fault detection (binary classification: fault/no-fault)

classData.csv ‚Üí Used for fault classification (multi-class: A, B, C, G)

### Features:

Ia, Ib, Ic, Va, Vb, Vc

### Targets:

Detection target: Output (S) ‚Üí 0 = No Fault, 1 = Fault

Classification target: A, B, C, G ‚Üí fault type identifiers

## Methodology
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
 - Missing columns were dropped (dropna(axis=1)).
 - Data split into train (67%) and test (33%) sets using train_test_split().
 - Normalized class distribution visualized using Seaborn bar plots.
